      What is a Digital Torque Wrench?
In a nutshell, it’s a torque wrench that uses digital technology. Common features of a digital torque wrench include a fully digital interface (as opposed to a traditional needle gauge), some wrenches offer visual and audio feedback signals, a few select wrenches have electric motors, and higher-end digital torque wrenches can even be integrated into your computer and other industrial appliances.
These tools are used for a variety of different tasks across many industries – including home repairs and maintenance, automotive and construction.
It’s important to always use this tool in applications where screws and bolts must be secure and tight. These tools allow the user to measure the amount of pressure being applied to fasteners, to ensure it matches the recommended specifications for the job.
In the automotive industry, for example, it’s paramount that the right amount of torque is used for all fasteners on a vehicle, to protect the safety of everyone who comes into contact with it.
